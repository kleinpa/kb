# keyboard-toolkit

A helpful box of tools that bring together
[KiCad](https://gitlab.com/kicad/code/kicad),
[exdxf](https://ezdxf.mozman.at/),
[Shapely](https://github.com/Toblerity/Shapely), and
[Bazel](https://bazel.build/) to explore code-based CAD ideas and make
neat keyboards. There's lots of fun stuff inside:

* Write a function to arrange your keys or load them from
  [keyboard-layout-editor.com](http://www.keyboard-layout-editor.com/).
* Produce ready-to-route PCBs with your choice of microcontroller and
  switch.
* Generate DXF files (or Gerbers!) for top and bottom plates.
* Generate QMK headers from the same source of truth as the schematic.

There's still lots of work to do before this is ready for casual use
but I have already used it to produce one real-world keyboard.
